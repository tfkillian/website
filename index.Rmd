<br/>
I'm a bioinformatician and data scientist who develops open source research software, builds analytical data pipelines and performs omics data analyses in collaboration with various research groups. My research interests include integrating multiomics datasets, data mining, computational biology, reproducible research, applied machine learning, the molecular biology of cancer and longevity, bionanotechnology and synthetic biology. I enjoy helping others discover the utility of R, Python and Bash in exploring the world of data. My hobbies include bike touring, climbing volcanoes, mushroom hunting and raising carnivorous plants.

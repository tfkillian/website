<br/>
I am very passionate about bioinformatics and data science. I perform
omics analyses on diverse types of biological data including: single cell and
bulk RNAseq, proteomic, metabolomic, ATACseq, SNP calling and flow cytometry. I
also develop open source research software, especially analytical pipelines and
web applications. My research interests are focused on integration of multiomics
data, applying machine learning to the molecular biology of cancer and
longevity, reproducible research, bionanotechnology and synthetic biology. My
hobbies include bike touring, climbing volcanoes, mushroom hunting and raising
carnivorous plants.
